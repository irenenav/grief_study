"The sample size has been calculated to be 60 individuals in each group, which is a total of 120 individuals. Twelve individuals will be selected from two health centers of each of the 10 universities. This calculation has been done using the G*Power software (37) for comparing the grief intensity score as the primary outcome among the two groups and based on the results of the pilot study. In this calculation, the type one error (α) is 0.05, the type two error (β) is 0.2, the effect size (d) is 0.5, and the drop-out expectation is 20% of the participants."
